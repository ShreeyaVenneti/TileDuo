# TileDuo
The game consists of two levels, each level has a 4x4 grid of closed tiles (face
down). The player must click on a tile to open it, revealing an image behind
it. This tile stays open until another tile is clicked. If the image under the
second tile matches with the first, then both tiles are matched and they are
disabled. Otherwise, both tiles are closed. Thus it is a memory game, and to
win the game the player must open all the tiles within the stipulated time.
There are two special tiles : a bomb tile and a bonus tile hidden within the
grid to make the game more interesting. The playerâ€™s score gets reduced
and increases upon clicking each of them respectively.
